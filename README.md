# hiragana-dataset
----
A small dataset with handwritten pictures of hiragana, with 20 samples for each kana. It covers every hiragana, plus a few examples of characters with dakuten and handakuten, totalizing 1000 images. 

This dataset was made using a Python program that using Image Processing techniques, extracted each individual character from a scanned sheet of paper with the characters written in it.

This is really a small dataset, but it works for testing purposes, such as making a Neural Network to identify each different hiragana using MATLAB, for example. A simple script to import this dataset to MATLAB is available in the repository.

If you used this dataset in any way, please let me know, I will be glad that maybe this small set of pictures helped someone.
